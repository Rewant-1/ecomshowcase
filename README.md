# Stellar Precision — Showcase

This repository contains a polished showcase website for Stellar Precision — a company presenting scientific and timekeeping instruments. The project is a light, responsive React + Tailwind template focused on aesthetics and product presentation rather than e-commerce functionality.

## Purpose

This is a non-commercial showcase template used to present Stellar Precision's product categories (Telescopes, Compasses, Sundials, Table Clocks, Walking Sticks, Binoculars) with a clean, modern design and smooth animations.

### Support notes
We are shipping our templates with a very basic React configuration to let you quickly get into the development process, but we don't discourage you from using any other configuration or framework built on the top of React. So, please note that any request dealing with React (e.g. extra features, customisations, et cetera) is to be considered out of the support scope.
