I am your client. My company “Stellar Precision” sells scientific and timekeeping products. I need a showcase website (not e-commerce) where I can present my products 
 We have 6 product categories:
Telescopes
Compasses
Sundials
Table Clocks
Walking Sticks
Binoculars
Each category should display 5–10 products (dummy products with images, names, price, and a short description).


Client Requirements:
Light theme design (no dark/black background).


Modern animations (smooth transitions, hover effects, etc.).


Mobile responsive (works properly on mobile, tablet, desktop).


Attractive product/category listing layout.


Clean and professional typography.


Fast performance (optimized, not heavy).


Easy navigation (menu with categories, product pages linked).

We are more focused on aesthetics and design quality than deep development. The website should have a pure, clean, and modern design with light colors, smooth animations, and a premium feel.
